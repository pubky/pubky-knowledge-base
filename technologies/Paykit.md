Paykit abstracts and automates any payment method behind a single, static public key. The public key belongs to a Pubky instance and points to a [data store](pubky-core/Data%20Stores.md) containing all supported payment endpoints. Paykit enables applications where users pay directly to profiles, so offers a very intuitive experience, particularly when multiple payment methods are possible within the system.
