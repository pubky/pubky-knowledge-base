## Pubky Aggregators

Aggregators collect and normalize social data from multiple [[1.Data Stores|data stores]]:

- Initial aggregation starts from a core user graph and expands outward through connections.

- Fine-grained access controls allow selective data sharing between users and aggregators.

- Merkle trees enable efficient synchronization of incremental changes from [[1.Data Stores|stores]].

- Normalized data schemas support interoperability between services.

- Public aggregators operate at scale for discoverability, while smaller niche aggregates also exist.

- [[2.Censorship|Censorship resistance]] comes from distributing aggregation across independent operators.

- Microservices enable modular aggregation of different data types (profiles, posts, comments, etc).
