Understanding the expectations and limitations of [[0.Introduction|PKARR]] is crucial for effective use. This note outlines what [[0.Introduction|PKARR]] is not and what users should expect.

## Not a Storage Platform

[[0.Introduction|PKARR]] is not a storage platform. Records are ephemeral and need to be refreshed regularly to remain on the DHT.

## Not a Real-time Communication Medium

[[0.Introduction|PKARR]] is not designed for real-time communication. It is optimized for infrequent updates and heavy caching to reduce traffic.

## Rate Limiting and Proof of Work

Expectations include enforcing harsh rate-limiting and possibly demanding proof of work for updates.

## Caching and Propagation Time

Records are heavily cached, and updates might take some time to propagate. In case of a cache miss, querying the [[DHT]] might take a few seconds.
