## Pubky Protocols

Pubky is defined by several open protocols that enable independent implementations:

**Pubky Data** - Definition of normalized data schemas for user profiles, content types, relationships etc. Allows unified querying across services.

**Pubky Sync** - Mechanism for efficiently synchronizing incremental changes between data stores, aggregators, and consumers using Merkle trees.

**Pubky Search** - Format for full-text search indices and queries across aggregated Pubky Data. Enables cross-platform discovery.

**Pubky Payments** - Decentralized and interoperable payment protocol for microtransactions like tips, subscriptions and purchasing goods/services.

**Pubky Identity** - Self-sovereign digital credentials for authentication without centralized authorities like usernames/passwords.

**Pubky Federation** - Standard for distributed moderation and cross-instance relationships between interconnected but independent communities.
