## Pubky Adoption

This note is indicative and creative. There is no set on stone plans for realizing adoption, these are just ideas. Realizing the full potential of Pubky relies on network effects through mainstream user onboarding:

- Legacy centralized imports ease migration paths for established communities and profiles.

- Simplified wallet and key management avoids barriers through friendly UX.

- Default public profiles paired with granular privacy, encourage open participation.

- Progressive web apps ([PWA](https://web.dev/articles/what-are-pwas)) maintain familiar experience across any device.

- Incentivized discovery games spark initial engagements like following interesting accounts.

- Federation with aligned systems like Mastodon expands the userbase through existing clusters.

- Grassroots developers support localized languages/cultures for global inclusion.

- Documentation, scholarships and bounties lower the skill floor for contributing back to protocols.

Overall, Pubky relies on being ready and available at the right time and right place. Most likely users will only discover Pubky during a [[2.Censorship]] attack.
