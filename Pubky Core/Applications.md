Apps build specialized frontends tailored for specific workflows or platforms.

## Pubky Applications

Application Backends power features by integrating aggregated data:

- [[Feeds]] curate timelines, hashtags, profiles and notify users.

- [[Search]] indexes enable full-text/attribute queries across user profiles and content.

- Communities facilitate moderation and discovery around shared interests.

- [Payments](Paykit.md) handle microtransactions like tipping within a peer-to-peer economy.

- Identity services provide single sign-on through self-sovereign credentials.

By decoupling features from centralized control, independent development remains open and vibrant.
