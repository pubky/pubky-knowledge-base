## Pubky Core Overview

![[pubky_core_arch.png]]

Pubky is built on a few core concepts:

- **[[1.Data Stores|Data Stores]]** - Decentralized data storage nodes that host user data. Data is encrypted at rest.

- **[[2.Aggregators|Aggregators]]** - Services that collect and aggregate data from multiple [[1.Data Stores|data stores]] into a single normalized view.

- **[[Feeds]]** - Curated views of aggregated data presented to users. Can include timelines, hashtags, profiles, etc.

- **[[Pubky Core/Search|Search]]** - Services that index aggregated data and enable full text/attribute searches.

- **[Application Backends](3.Applications.md)** - Backend services that integrate feeds, search, and user interfaces/configurations.

- **[[Pkarr/index|Pkarr]]** - Self-issued public keys that function as sovereign, publicly addressable domains are used to resolve the previous components.

Pubky's distributed architecture aims to provide user autonomy through [[3.Credible Exit|credible exit]] between interchangeable components.
