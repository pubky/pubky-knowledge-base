## Pubky Data Stores

Data Stores are decentralized storage nodes that host user data in an encrypted format. Key aspects include:

- Data is encrypted at rest using users' public keys. Only the user has access.

- The user also has the option to publish public data and be accessible for everyone

- Stores provide access to data through an API or via Pub/Sub, allowing reads by authorized services.

- Versioning and conflict resolution is handled through Merkle trees for efficient syncing.

- Stores can be run by individuals, co-ops, or commercial providers anonymously.

- Redundancy is achieved through data replication across multiple data stores.

- [[2.Incentives|Incentives]] encourage availability through services fees or peer-to-peer micropayments.

- Data control remains with users even if a store goes offline through [[3.Credible Exit|credible exit]] options.
