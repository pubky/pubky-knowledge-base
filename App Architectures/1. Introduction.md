Leveraging the [[Pubky Core/Introduction|Introduction]] protocol as the foundational layer, we can envision app a diverse array of client applications with distinct functionalities. While each app can implement its own unique design patterns and user interfaces, they all share a common underlying architecture: interacting with the distributed data stores, colloquially referred to as [[Data Stores |home servers]], through standardized read and write operations.

The [[Pubky Core/Introduction|Pubky Core protocol]] enables a decentralized approach to data management, facilitating seamless communication between clients and their respective data stores. This architecture promotes data sovereignty and enhances system resilience.

Below, we present several high-level designs that showcase the versatility of this architecture, from simple client (browser) apps that interact directly with one or several homeservers to more complex applications with custom aggregators and backends capable of powerful inference:

- [[2. Client - Homeserver|Client-Homeserver]]
- [[4. Custom Backend|Custom backend]]
- [[3. Global Aggregators|Global aggregators]]
