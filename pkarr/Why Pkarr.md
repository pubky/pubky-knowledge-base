This section explores the motivation behind Pkarr, addressing the challenges of distributed semantics, databases, and discovery.

## Distributed Semantics

Pkarr aims to develop interoperable semantics for verifiable metadata about public keys, forming a digital identity with reputation, social graph, credentials, and more.

## Distributed Databases

The system supports a host-agnostic database essential for an open web, moving away from walled gardens.

## Distributed Discovery

Addressing distributed discovery first helps solve the most pressing issues and provides a foundation for solving the others.

## Leveraging Pkarr

Pkarr addresses unavailability, [[Censorship]] , deplatforming, and key management with minimal effort, leveraging existing technologies like [[Mainline DHT]] and web servers.
