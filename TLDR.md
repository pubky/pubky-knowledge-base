## TLDR; [pubky.app](pubky-app) in Brief

[pubky.app](pubky-app) is a decentralized alternative to social media platforms like Twitter. It uses a distributed architecture where:

- Users host their own data on independent [[data stores]]
- Services [aggregate](pubky-core/Aggregators.md) data across stores into a unified view
- [[Feeds]] and search present curated views of the aggregated data
- [Application](pubky-core/Applications.md) back-ends integrate features without centralized control

The end goal is to give individuals self-sovereign digital identity and true ownership over social profiles/activity without fear of data misuse or account bans by any single entity.
