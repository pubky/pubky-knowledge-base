# Pubky Knowledge Base as Obsidian+Quartz site

## Add Knowledge

The root directory is an Obsidian Vault. Just add Pubky knowledge to it!

The current Knowledge base is a mix of reality, dreams, visions, actuality and plans.

## Build static Quartz site

Go into the `/quartz` dir `cd quartz`. Install deps with `npm install` then build the site with `npm run docs`. Check it out at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)
