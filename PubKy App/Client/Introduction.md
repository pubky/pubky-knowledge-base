# Pubky Client

![pubkey-client](pubky-header.png)

The Pubky client will be available as both a desktop application and a hosted website service (standard website) that allows users to interface with the social media layer of [[PubKy App/Backend/Introduction|Pubky Backend]] using [Synonym](https://synonym.to/) hosted services.

Using the library analogy again, the Pubky Client is like a personalized research assistant who takes the prepared documents from the librarian ([[PubKy App/Backend/Introduction|backend]]) and creates a customized report just for you. This report is designed to be easy to read and understand, with all the relevant information presented in a clear and concise manner.

- Users are able to take control of the data and exit the Synonym hosted services and run their own without hampering discoverability ([[3.Credible Exit|credible exit]]).

- Pubky client uses the open [[Pubky Core/Introduction|Pubky Core]] for nearly all features, allowing users to avoid censorship by choosing self-hosting or alternate hosts without losing followers or integrity. 

- Pubky also features support for [[Paykit|paykit]], our open payment protocol for coordinating payments among peers supporting various methods. This allows users to create sub-accounts from master wallets for familiar payment experiences. This suite of features removes any requirement from [Synonym](https://synonym.to/) to custody user funds, while allowing for users to set up subscriptions, recurring payments, paywalls, etc, in a P2P way. This feature will not be in the first launch version of Pubky app, but it is worth noting that next year we will enable all users to buy and sell data in this way.

- Communities facilitate moderation and discovery around shared interests.
