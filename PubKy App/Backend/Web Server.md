The system comprises a suite of **backend services** that orchestrate the integration of **data feeds**, **search functionality**, and **user interface configurations**. The system provides a unified platform for data ingestion, processing, and presentation, enabling seamless interactions between the frontend and backend components. 

### Services

- __Feeds__ - Curated views of aggregated data presented to users. Can include timelines, [[Tags|tags]], [[Profiles|profiles]], etc.
- __Search__ - Services that index aggregated data and enable full text/attribute searches.
- __Identity__ - It provides single sign-on through self-sovereign credentials. 
- [Payments](Paykit.md) - It handles microtransactions like tipping within a peer-to-peer economy.

### Architecture

The web server can be designed and implemented using various architectural patterns, depending on the specific requirements of the data request workflow. Two prominent architectural styles that can be employed are:

- **Monolithic Architecture**: A **single-tiered architecture** where the web server is constructed as a self-contained unit, encompassing all necessary components and functionality. This approach is characterized by a **tightly-coupled** design, where all components are integrated into a single executable or deployable unit.
- **Microservices Architecture**: A **multi-tiered architecture** where the web server is decomposed into a collection of **loosely-coupled**, independent services that communicate with each other using **APIs** and **messaging protocols**. Each microservice is responsible for a specific **business capability** or **data domain**, enabling greater flexibility, scalability, and resilience.

The choice of architecture depends on various factors, including **data request patterns**, **traffic volume**, **performance requirements**, **development team expertise**, and **maintenance considerations**.
