# Pubky App

Pubky App will be available as both a desktop application and a hosted website service (standard website) that allows users to interface with the social media layer of Pubky using Synonym hosted services. Synonym will be initially hosting: [[1.Data Stores |Data stores]], [[2.Aggregators|aggregators]], [[Feeds|feeds]], [[Pubky Core/Search|search]] and Application Backends.

- Users are able to take control of the data and exit the Synonym hosted services and run their own without hampering discoverability ([[3.Credible Exit|credible exit]]).

- Aggregators and Application Backends use cryptographically signed data and reformat and render data within multiple familiar formats like social media, photo feeds, forums etc. All from the same source data, with verifiable sources. Users can run Pubky locally, or rely on our servers for trust-minimized hosting and rendering.

- Pubky App uses the open Pubky Core for nearly all features, allowing users to avoid censorship by choosing self-hosting or alternate hosts without losing followers or integrity. 

- Pubky also features support for Paykit, our open payment protocol for coordinating payments among peers supporting various methods. This allows users to create sub-accounts from master wallets for familiar payment experiences. This suite of features removes any requirement from Synonym to custody user funds, while allowing for users to set up subscriptions, recurring payments, paywalls, etc, in a P2P way. 

- This feature will not be in the first launch version of Pubky app, but it is worth noting that next year we will enable all users to buy and sell data in this way.
