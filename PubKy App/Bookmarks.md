# Bookmarks

Bookmarks are a feature that allows you to privately save post for later reference. Here are some ways you can use bookmarks:

1. **Save for later reading**: If you come across a post that you don't have time to read or engage with immediately, you can bookmark it to read later when you have more time.
2. **Reference material**: Bookmarks can serve as a repository for tweets that contain useful information, such as articles, tutorials, or resources, that you might need to refer to later. In that case, you can organise the posts by topic.
3. **Private note-taking**: Bookmarks can serve as a private note-taking system, allowing you to save tweets that you want to remember without having to publicly like or retweet them.

To bookmark a post, simply click or tap the "Bookmark" icon (it looks like a ribbon) on the post. You can access your bookmarked posts by clicking the button on top of the page.
