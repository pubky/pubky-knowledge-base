# Welcome to the Pubky Knowledge Base

This is the [[Pubky Core/Introduction|Pubky Core]] and [[Pubky App/Introduction|Pubky App]] knowledge base. Currently these docs are a mix of reality, dreams, visions, technicalities, actuality and plans.

1. Cloud storage with [[3.Credible Exit|credible exit]] (in the current implementation, it is just a web server + [[0.Introduction|pkarr]])
2. On top of that we build a [[1.Web of Trust|Web of Trust]]
3. [[Pubky App/Introduction|Pubky App]] is the main demonstration of how should this distributed data be crawled, indexed and searched at scale (albeit at a centralized setup).
4. By decoupling features from centralized control, independent development remains open and vibrant.

## Get Started

A good place to start is the [[Pubky App/Introduction|Pubky App]], [[TLDR]] or our pubky-core [[ELI5]]
