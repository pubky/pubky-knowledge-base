title: Welcome to the Pubky Knowledge Base
---

This is the [[pubky-core]] and [pubky.app](Pubky%20App.md) knowledge base. Currently these docs are a mix of reality, dreams, visions, technicalities, actuality and plans.

1. Cloud storage with [[Credible Exit]] (in the current implementation it is just a web server + [[Pkarr]].org)
2. On top of that we build a [[Web of Trust]]
3. [pubky.app](Pubky%20App.md) is the main demonstration of how should this distributed data be crawled, indexed and searched at scale (albeit at a centralized setup).

## Get Started

A good place to start is the [pubky.app](Pubky%20App.md) [[TLDR]] or our pubky-core [[ELI5]]
