## Welcome to the Pubky Knowledge Base

This is a knowledge base for the Pubky platform, which includes [[Explore/Pubky Core/Introduction|Pubky Core]], [[0.Introduction|PKARR]] and [[Explore/Pubky App/Introduction|Pubky App]]. These documents are a work in progress, much like Pubky's protocols and applications!

## What is Pubky?

Pubky attempts to unlock the web by realizing our vision for a key-based, self-regulating web that puts users in control.

So far, Pubky does this by combining practical decentralized routing & identity ([[0.Introduction|PKARR]]), with simple interoperable hosting ([[Homeservers|Homeservers]]) that allow for [[Censorship|censorship]] resistance and a [[Credible Exit|credible exit]], as well as a publishing application, Pubky App, that facilitates the creation of a [[Semantic Social Graph|Semantic Social Graph]], which can be used for filtering, discovery, matching and coordination.
