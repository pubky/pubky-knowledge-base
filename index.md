# Welcome to the Pubky Knowledge Base

This is a knowledge base for the Pubky platform, which includes [[Pubky Core/Introduction|Pubky Core]], [[Pubky Core/Pkarr/Introduction|PKARR]] and [[Pubky App/Introduction|Pubky App]]. These documents are a work in progress, much like Pubky's protocols and applications!

# What is Pubky?

Pubky attempts to unlock the web by realizing our vision for a key-based, self-regulating web that puts users in control. 

So far, Pubky does this by combining practical decentralized routing & identity ([[Pubky Core/Pkarr/Introduction|PKARR]]), with simple interoperable hosting ([[Pubky Core/Data Stores|Homeservers]]) that allow for a [[3.Credible Exit|Credible Exit]], and a publishing application that facilitates the creation of a [[Concepts/Semantic Social Graph|Semantic Social Graph]], which can be used for filtering, discovery, matching and coordination.
