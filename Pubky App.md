## Pubky.app Social Media

Pubky-app's initial focus is building a decentralized social media protocol. Key aspects include:

- User profiles hosted on [[Data Stores]]

- Post/comment/like data stored with profiles

- [[Aggregators]] collecting social graphs

- [[Feeds]] of followings' activities

- [[Search]]ing profiles and posts

- Notification delivery through [Application](Applications.md) Backends

- Distributed moderation through [user blocking](Web%20of%20Trust.md)

The goal is to recreate core social features without dependence on any centralized company or platform.
