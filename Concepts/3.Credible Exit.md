It is a concept that emphasizes the ability for users to leave a platform or service without being locked in, maintaining control over their data and experiences. This concept is gaining traction as a way to ensure user autonomy and foster competition among service providers.

This [substack post](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/credible-exit) by Gordon Brander is a good read as introduction to the topic. The following is a summary:

## Examples of Credible Exit

- **[[DNS]]**: Allows users to move domain names between hosting providers, preventing vendor lock-in and promoting competition.
- **Email**: Offers the ability to switch between email service providers and save emails locally, enhancing user control over personal data.
- **Podcasts**: Supports importing and exporting subscriptions, facilitating easy transition between platforms.
- **Mirror.xyz**: Utilizes distributed protocols for data replication and storage, ensuring data can be reconstructed without relying on central services.
- **GitHub**: Provides credible exit for code through Git, allowing users to clone repositories and contribute to open-source projects.
- **Mastodon**: Enables federation between different instances, allowing users to move between servers without losing their data.

## Important Aspects of Credible Exit

- **Protocols**: The foundation of credible exit, enabling communication and data transfer between systems.
- **Data Importance**: Differentiating between basic data (content created by users) and generated data (interactions, likes, comments), which may require different approaches for exit.
- **Dimensions of Credible Exit**: Including the ability to export data, sync data across platforms, use data in useful formats, and store data in local files.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Static Exports**: While GDPR regulations allow for data exports, the static nature of these exports can limit their utility for ongoing use.
- **Data Formats**: The importance of using common, useful formats for data to ensure it can be utilized elsewhere.
- **Interoperability**: The potential for multiple apps to share data through permissionless APIs, enhancing broad interoperability.
