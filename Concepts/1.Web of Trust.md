# Web of Trust

The "Web of Trust" is a decentralized trust model used in cryptography, particularly in systems like _PGP_, _GnuPG_, and other _OpenPGP_ compatible systems, to establish the authenticity of the binding between a public key and its owner.

This model is an alternative to the centralized trust model of a __Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)__, which relies on a __certificate authority (CA)__ or a hierarchy of such authorities.

The concept, first introduced by _PGP_ creator [Phil Zimmermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Zimmermann#PGP) in 1992, allows users to accumulate keys from others and designate them as trusted introducers. Over time, users distribute a collection of certifying signatures with their keys, expecting that anyone receiving these will trust at least one or two of the signatures. This process leads to the emergence of a decentralized, fault-tolerant web of confidence for all public keys, enabling a peer-to-peer rating system that verifies public keys and their owners without relying on a central identity authority.
