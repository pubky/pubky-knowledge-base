## ELI5: Pubky Explained for Children

Pubky is like a school where instead of one principal running the whole school, different teachers run classrooms by their own.

The "teachers" ([[data stores]]) host all the students' school work. The "janitors" ([[aggregators]]) help move the work between classrooms so everyone can see it.

The "lunch lady" ([[feeds]]) puts together trays of work for everyone to look at during recess. And the "librarian" ([[search]]) helps you find specific things across the student's works.
