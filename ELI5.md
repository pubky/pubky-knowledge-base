## ELI5: Pubky Explained for Children

Like a kite, [data](1.Data%20Stores.md) is in the cloud, but you hold its string.

Your friends can find your messages by finding your kite in the sky ([[Pkarr/index]] in the [[DHT]]) and following the string down to the message board you are currently posting on.

You can move your kite (your [data](1.Data%20Stores.md)) anywhere and your friends will still be able to find it as long as you are holding the string of the kite ([[Pkarr/index]] private key).
