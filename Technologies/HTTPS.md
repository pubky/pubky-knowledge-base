# Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure - HTTPS

It is an extension of HTTP that encrypts communication over a computer network, enhancing security and privacy. It uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) or SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for encryption, protecting against eavesdropping and tampering. HTTPS is essential for securely transmitting sensitive data, such as login credentials and financial transactions, ensuring the authenticity of websites and the privacy of user communications.

## Key Features

- **Encryption**: Secures data in transit using TLS/SSL, making it unreadable to interceptors.

- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of websites and services using digital certificates, ensuring users are communicating with the intended party.

- **Protection**: Guards against man-in-the-middle attacks and [[DNS]] spoofing, safeguarding user data and privacy.
