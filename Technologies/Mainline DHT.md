Mainline [[DHT]] is a standard Distributed Hash Table (DHT) implementation widely used in the BitTorrent network, based on the [Kademlia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia) protocol. This decentralized system allows for efficient data storage and retrieval across a vast network of nodes, making it highly resilient and scalable.

## Key Features

- **Decentralization**: It operates without a central authority, enhancing its resilience against failures and [[2.Censorship|censorship]].
- **Scalability**: It can easily scale to accommodate more data and users by adding more nodes to the network.
- **Efficiency**: By distributing data across multiple nodes, Mainline DHT provides fast access to data without the need for a central server.

## Applications

- **BitTorrent Network**: Mainline DHT adds tracker capabilities to each peer in the BitTorrent network, enhancing its resilience and reducing dependency on centralized trackers.
- **Peer-to-Peer File Sharing**: Beyond BitTorrent, DHTs like Mainline are used for instant messaging, name resolution, and other peer-to-peer file sharing applications.
