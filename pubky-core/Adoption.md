## Pubky Adoption

Realizing the full potential of Pubky relies on network effects through mainstream user onboarding:

- Legacy centralized imports ease migration paths for established communities and profiles.

- Simplified wallet and key management avoids barriers through friendly UX.

- Default public profiles paired with granular privacy encourage open participation.

- Progressive web apps maintain familiar experience across any device.

- Incentivized discovery games spark initial engagements like following interesting accounts.

- Federation with aligned systems like Mastodon expands the userbase through existing clusters.

- Grassroots developers support localized languages/cultures for global inclusion.

- Documentation, scholarships and bounties lower the skill floor for contributing back to protocols.

The goal is surfacing the empowering aspects of decentralization to everyone.
