## Pubky Incentives

For the Pubky ecosystem to function at scale, it relies on incentives that encourage participation and uphold the user experience:

- Data storage fees pay stores for availability and throughput.

- Tipping and subscriptions reward high-quality contributors and curators.

- Advertising supports free-tier services and indexes through contextual/non-intrusive formats.

- Validation bonds and slashing conditions secure protocol compliance.

- Data marketplace sales enable professional content creators to profit directly.

- Job boards and service directories create opportunities within the emerging peer-to-peer economy.

Together, these push the system towards collective benefit over individual maximization.
