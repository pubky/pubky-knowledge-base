# Notifications

Pubky client tracks various event or activities the user may be interested in, and provides relevant notifications for interactions and other relevant activity to the user. Notifications are a way to keep you informed about what's happening in the app, even when you're not actively browsing your timeline.

Here are some common types of notifications you might receive:

1. **Mentions**: When someone mentions you in a [[Posts|post]], you'll receive a notification. This means they've included your public key (__pk:pubky__) in their [[Posts|post]].
2. **Replies**: If someone replies to one of your [[Posts|post]], you'll get a notification.
3. **Re-posts**: If someone re-posts one of your posts, you'll get a notification.
4. **Follows**: When someone new follows you, you'll receive a notification.
5. **Quote Posts**: If someone quotes one of your posts, you'll receive a notification.
