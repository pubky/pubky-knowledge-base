# Profiles

In Pubky client, a **profile** refers to a user's personal page on the app, which displays their information, posts, and other content. A Pubky profile is a unique identity that represents a public-key.

Here are some key components of a Pubky profile:

1. **Username**: A unique handle or identifier that represents the user, often preceded by the "pk" keyword(e.g. _pk:uudfeafc1c6dhxxnaiyuzss5ln9i1ikpb8syht46qpnx4ksi6ho_).
