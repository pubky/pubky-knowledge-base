They are keywords or phrases that are added to a tweet to help users find and engage with the content. Users can publicly assign contextual tags, like hashtags, to any other user or post. Tags can be used to filter posts and users. Users can also choose custom weighting of tags when filtering.

**How do tags work?**

1. **Hashtags**: Tags are denoted by the "#" symbol, followed by a word or phrase. For example, #Pubky, #privacy, or #segwit.
2. **Clickability**: When you click on a tag, Pubky client takes you to a page that displays all the posts that have used that same tag.
3. **Discovery**: Tags help users discover new content, accounts, and conversations related to a specific topic.
4. **Categorization**: Tags help categorize posts, making it easier for users to find and engage with content that interests them.
