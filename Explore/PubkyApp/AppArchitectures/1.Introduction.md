Leveraging the [[Explore/PubkyCore/Introduction|Pubky Core]] protocol as the foundational layer, we can envision a diverse array of applications with distinct functionalities. While each app can implement its own unique design patterns and user interfaces, they all share a common underlying architecture: interacting with the distributed data stores, colloquially referred to as [[Homeserver|homeservers]], through standardized read and write operations.

The [[Explore/PubkyCore/Introduction|Pubky Core protocol]] enables a decentralized approach to data management, facilitating seamless communication between clients and their respective data stores. This architecture promotes data sovereignty and enhances system resilience.

Below, we present several high-level designs that showcase the versatility of this architecture, from simple client (browser) apps that interact directly with one or several [[Homeserver|homeservers]] to more complex applications with custom aggregators and backends capable of powerful inference:

- [[2.ClientHomeserver|Client-Homeserver]]
- [[4.CustomBackend|Custom backend]]
- [[3.GlobalAggregators|Global aggregators]]
