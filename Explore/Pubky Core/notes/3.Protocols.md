## Pubky Protocols

This note is indicative and highly creative. We have not yet explored much about the open protocols that enable independent implementations:

**Pubky App Specs** - Specification of normalized data schemas for user profiles, content types, and relationships (posts, tags, bookmarks, follows, feeds). The [pubky-app-specs](https://github.com/pubky/pubky-app-specs) repository defines these models with validation rules to ensure data consistency and interoperability across Pubky applications. Available as [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pubky-app-specs) for JavaScript/TypeScript developers and as Rust crates. **Note**: Currently v0.4.0 in rapid development with frequent changes expected before v1 stabilization.

**Pubky Sync** - Mechanism for efficiently synchronizing incremental changes between data stores, aggregators, and consumers using Merkle trees.

**Pubky Search** - Format for full-text search indices and queries across aggregated data. Enables cross-platform discovery.

**[Pubky Payments](Paykit.md)** - Payment protocol (work in progress) for discovering and coordinating payments across Bitcoin onchain, Lightning Network, and potentially other methods. Features encrypted negotiation channels, subscription management, and auto-pay automation. Currently under active development and testing in Bitkit iOS and Android. Not production-ready.

**[Pubky Noise](Pubky Noise.md)** - Noise Protocol implementation providing encrypted communication channels for the Pubky ecosystem. Used by Paykit for payment negotiation and can support other use cases requiring private peer-to-peer communication. Work in progress.

**Pubky Identity** - Self-sovereign digital credentials for authentication without centralized authorities like usernames/passwords.

**Pubky Federation** - Standard for distributed moderation and cross-instance relationships between interconnected but independent communities.
