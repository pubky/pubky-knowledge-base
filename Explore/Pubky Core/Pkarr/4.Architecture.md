In-depth look at the architecture of [[0.Introduction|PKARR]], including its components and how they interact.
## Components

- **Client**: Applications or users that publish or query [[0.Introduction|PKARR]].
- **Relay**: Optional intermediary that helps clients behind NAT or firewall to communicate with the [[Mainline DHT]].
- **[[Mainline DHT]]**: The peer-to-peer network used to announce and resolve [[0.Introduction|PKARR]] records.
- **Republisher**: Services that keep [[0.Introduction|PKARR]] alive on the [[Mainline DHT]] by [periodically republishing](https://github.com/pubky/pkarr-churn/blob/main/results-node_decay.md) them.

## Interaction Flow

1. **Publishing**: Clients publish [[0.Introduction|PKARR]] to the [[Mainline DHT]], either directly or through a relay (required for browsers since the DHT uses UDP).
2. **Republishing**: Homeservers and relays republish records for their users to [keep them available](https://github.com/pubky/pkarr-churn/blob/main/results-node_decay.md) on the [[Mainline DHT]].
3. **Querying**: Clients query the [[Mainline DHT]] for [[0.Introduction|PKARR]], either directly or through a relay.

## Key Technologies

- **[[Mainline DHT]]**: A global, censorship-resistant p2p network of 10+ million peers. [[0.Introduction|PKARR]] are announced here using BEP44.
